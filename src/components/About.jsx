               As a recent graduate with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science (BSc) and over one and a half years of experience in a non-voice process at Sutherland Global Services, I have developed a strong foundation in problem-solving and customer service. My passion for technology and web development led me to pursue a comprehensive Python full stack development course, equipping me with the skills to build dynamic and responsive web applications.

               Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have honed my abilities in both front-end and back-end development, gaining proficiency in Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and various frameworks. My hands-on experience with a demo project has further solidified my understanding of the full stack development process, from designing user interfaces to managing databases.

               I am eager to leverage my technical expertise and dedication to continuous learning to contribute to innovative web development projects. My goal is to join a forward-thinking organization where I can apply my skills to create impactful digital solutions and further grow as a full stack developer.
